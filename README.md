## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **GIPHY Clone** built using **React JS 18**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **GIPHY API**. It lets users search, view, and favorite GIFs and stickers. The app is fully responsive, supports category filtering, sharing, and embedding of GIFs — making it an ideal resume project for frontend developers.

Inspired by the [Roadside Coder YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<YouTubeVideoID>) (May 5, 2024), this project also implements **Context API** for state management and **React Router v6** for navigation.
